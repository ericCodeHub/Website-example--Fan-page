            <h3>Quotes from the novel</h3>
            <blockquote>That was the danger of being old and a politician. Habits outlived the situations that created
                them. Policies remained in place after the situations that inspired them had changed. The calculus of
                all human power was changing, and the models she used to make sense of it shifted with them, and she had
                to keep reminding herself that the past was a different place. She didn’t live there anymore.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“So are you conscious?” The alien robot—the skin the Miller construct was using—shrugged. It was
                strange how well the gesture translated. “Don’t know. Seems like I’m acing my Turing test, though.”
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“It’s not that bad. Conspiracy theories come up whenever people feel like the universe is too
                random. Absurd. If it’s all an enemy plot, at least there’s someone calling the shots.”</blockquote>
